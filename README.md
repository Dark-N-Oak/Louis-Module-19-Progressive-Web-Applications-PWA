# Louis-Module-19-Progressive-Web-Applications-PWA
## Description
I've been task will building a Progressive-Web-Application. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. 
Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
I should see a client server folder structure when I open my application in my editor.
I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client when I run `npm run start` from the root directory.
I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack when I run the text editor application from my terminal.
I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file when I run my webpack plugins.
I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors when I use next-gen JavaScript in my application.
I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage when I open the text editor.
I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB when I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window.
I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB when I reopen the text editor after closing it.
I download my web application as an icon on my desktop when I click on the Install button.
I should have a registered service worker using workbox when I load my web application.
I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets when I register a service worker.
I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application when I deploy to Render.
I made the application be able to function offline. Lastly, I made sure to leave the code better than I found it.
